### To the Customer:  
We are trying to find out what a good account area should feel like for customers.
Can you pretend that you have applied for a R&D grant from Scottish Enterprise. 
They have set up an online account area for you to administer your application.
And you are called Siobhan…
Which one works best ?

# Card Sorting
## Script

* We are adding an Account area to our website and we want it to make sense to customers. 
* To do this we are testing designs and also how people expect things to be grouped together.
* If you have 5 minutes to spare we have a quick activity to do that would really help us work out what groups work best for customers?
* We have a bunch of items that you drag and drop into whatever groups make sense to you.
* Once they are grouped, or during J,  you can give each group a name. 
* Once we have done this with hundreds of customers it should average out to quite a useful website design.
