###To the Customer:
We are trying to find out what a good account area should feel like for customers.Can you pretend that you have applied for a R&D grant from Scottish Enterprise. They have set up an online account area for you to administer your application.And you are called Siobhan…Which one works best ?

#Card Sorting
ScriptWe are adding an Account area to our website and we want it to make sense to customers. To do this we are testing designs and also how people expect things to be grouped together.If you have 5 minutes to spare we have a quick activity to do that would really help us work out what groups work best for customers?We have a bunch of items that you drag and drop into whatever groups make sense to you.Once they are grouped, or during J,  you can give each group a name. Once we have done this with hundreds of customers it should average out to quite a useful website design. ProbeLanguage on the cardsCustomer expectationsCustomer experiences on other sitesAreas where a card would be in multiple groupsMissing cardsCardsUpdate my company sales / turnover figuresUpdate my company informationView my company detailsView my SE contactsContact SEMy Scottish Enterprise account preferencesSet / update my marketing and contact preferencesSet up my alertsManage my alertsSet up my notificationsManage my notificationsManage my to-do listStart my funding applicationTrack my applicationsView my applicationsManage my grant claimsView assistance I'm currently receivingView assistance I've had in the pastView future assistance relevant to my companyStart my claim processManage all of my enquiriesDelete my accountIdentify potential overseas marketsLearn new business skillsSell into the European Union
